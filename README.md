## THE ROLE OF JAVASCRIPT IN WEB DEVELOPMENT

### Example !

#### lets say where about to make a building what we need at first we need the resuorses like brick and wook and othere things thats html and once we took our building up to the sky what else we might need we need to make it look good thats where CSS comes and now that we have done everything right we build  our building we paint it make it look good we need light (electricy)  so that we can use left and othere thing for our comfort that light and the most important thing is  JS AKA JavaScript!


## A BRIEF HISTORY OF JAVASCRIPT 
### (1995)
#### brendan Eich created JavaScript in 10 days by the name of mocha.
### (1996)
#### then changed its name to LiveScript and then to JavaScript becuase at the time JAVA was taking over 

### (2015) 
#### ECMA relesed  its biggest update ever  
## JavaScript Variables and Constants
### In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.

#### In Javascript there is two types of intializing variables, var and let. You can use both of them.However, there are some differences between them.In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.If you are sure that the value of a variable won't change throughout the program, it's recommendedto use const .

## OBJECTS AND PRIMITIVES
### Value = Object or  Primitive

## PRIMITIVES
### Number  
#### it stands for every number type
### String  
#### used for text 
### Boolean  
#### for true and false 
### Undefined   
#### value is undefined 
### Null  
#### its something that is there but its empty
### Symbol
#### something uniqe but cant be changed
### Bigint
#### larger int that number cant hold
### keep in mind that the 8th Primitive is Object it slef
## Object 
### arry
### functions
### many more

# Reminder !
## JavaScript has dynamic typing  we do not  have to manually dfine the data type of  the value stored in a variable. instead  data type are determined automaticlly
# value has type not variable

# Rules for Naming JavaScript Variables
 ### name must start with a Litter  _,  or $sign and cnnot start with number

## we have 5 types of operators in JS
### 1 Arithmatics +,-,*,/ 
### 2 Compration ==,===,<= >=,,,
### 3 Logical  and , or, not
### 4 type converstion  Number("3.14")
### 5 Asignments  =,+=, -=, *=, /=, %=,

## we have two types of js conversation
### 1 implicit type conversation
#### Example impilicit conversation to string (3) "3"=33
### 2 epilicit type conversation

## we have 3 important topics in js 
### 1 Condations
### 2 Loops
### 3 functions

### we have tree types of functions 
### 1 if else 2 ternary operator 3 swich statment

## also we have 3 Loops
### 1 for loop 2 while loop 3 do/while 
## functions    
### there are 3 ways for writing functions in js 
### 1 function Declration that have parameter 
### 2 function Expression is only writed by  anonymous and arrow functions
### 3 function IIFE (imeadetly ivoked function Expression) that can only be used once and very fast it dont have a name
